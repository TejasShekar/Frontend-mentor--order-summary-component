## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. How to use display:flex and how I can save time using it.
2. How to add active states for buttons.
3. How to disable text selection and also remove blue box on tap

```css
button {
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

1. I still need to understand and practise more on what properties work on certain elements and what properties does not work. Also, I will be working on methods where I can avoid repetitive use of same properties over and over.
2. I need to understand how to use flexbox and also manipulate items inside each child of flexbox like dividing flexbox on custom proportions.
